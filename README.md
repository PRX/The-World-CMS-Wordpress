## Setup

This repository uses Lando for local development. Run the following commands:

1. Set up lando:

`lando start`

2. Retrieve and export of the database and place it in the `reference/` directory. If a database export does not exist within this directory the script will attempt to pull the database from Pantheon's dev environment.

Finally, it will generate a `local-admin` user for you.

`npm run refresh`
